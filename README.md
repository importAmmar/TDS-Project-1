# TDS-Project-1 (Mumbai:50)


* I scraped data from the GitHub API by using a personal access token to query users from Mumbai with at least 50 followers through the /search/users endpoint with the query string location:Mumbai followers:>=50, utilizing pagination to retrieve all results; I then retrieved detailed user information from the /users/{username} endpoint and fetched the top 500 repositories for each user using the /users/{username}/repos endpoint.
  
* Users who primarily use C++ for their projects have the highest average number of followers, even though C++ isn't among the top five most popular languages.
  
* Developers should focus on enhancing their skills in JavaScript and Python, as these languages have consistently dominated usage over the years; additionally, they should familiarize themselves with emerging tools like Jupyter Notebook, which has been used in the majority of projects from 2023 onwards, to stay relevant and adaptable in the evolving tech landscape.
